    <p><h3>The best no-added sugar banana bread - that actually tastes good!</h3>
    <p>If you're at a point in life where you're trying to eat a little healthier, you may be cutting back on your added sugar.</p>
    <p>However, that definitely doesn't mean you have to cut out dessert - just a few ripe bananas and (optional) chocolate chips, and you'll be able to satisfy your sweet tooth!</p>
    <p><h3>Ingredients:</h3></p>
    <ul>
        <li>500 grams peeled, overripe bananas</li>
        <li>1/4 cup olive oil or oil of your choice</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups oat flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
        <li>Optional: 1/2 cup 70% cacao chocolate chips. *See note</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325F and lightly grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.</li>
        <li>Mix the wet ingredients. In a large bowl, combine the bananas, oil, eggs, and vanilla extract and mix with a hand mixer or immersion blender until well combined.</li> 
        <li>Add the dry ingredients. Add the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and chcolate chips (if adding); stir just until combined. Pour batter into your prepared loaf pan.</li>
        <li>Bake and cool. Bake for 60 to 75 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out completely clean. Allow the bread cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer it to a wire rack and let it cool another 15-20 minutes before slicing.</li>  
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> If adding a 1/2 cup chocolate chips, this will result in the bread having ~2 grams of added sugar per slice.</p>
