    <p><h3>What makes this cookie special?</h3>
    <p>If you're craving a gooey, chewy chocolately chip cookie, then this recipe is for you. It's super easy to make with just a few ingredients that you probably have in your pantry right now!</p>
    <p>I wish I could say that this is a top secret family recipe that has been passed down for generations, but it's unfortunately not that exciting. However, even for a "modern" cookie, it's delicious.</p>
    <p><h3>Ingredients:</h3></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup salted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup light brown sugar, packed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 large eggs, room temperature</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li>1 cup chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix dry ingredients - flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Cream together butter and sugars until combined.</li>
        <li>Beat in eggs and vanilla until light and fluffy (on high for about 2 minutes).</li>
        <li>Fold in the dry ingredients until combined.</li>
        <li>Fold in chocolate chips and mix well.</li>
        <li> Spoon out 2-3 Tablespoons of dough and roll into balls, and place on cookie sheets. Leave enough space between the dough balls.</li>
        <li> Bake for 8-10 minutes, or until the edges are just starting to brown.</li>
        <li> Let cool (if you can wait that long!) and enjoy :)</l1>
